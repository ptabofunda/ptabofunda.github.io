Hi there! You have found my GitHub page. My name is Pedro Tabofunda. I am a Senior Test Engineer. I have 20+ years experience as a test and engineering productivity professional.

In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with my kids, listening to 90's music and gardening. 

You can find some samples of my personal projects on [Github](https://ptabofunda.github.io). I am always open to new opportunities and connections, so feel free to reach out to me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ptabofunda).

Thank you for visiting my page!
