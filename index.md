# About Me

<img src="./assets/img/me.png" alt="me" style="width: 20%; height: auto;" />

Hi there! You have found my GitHub page. My name is Pedro Tabofunda. I am a Senior Test Engineer. I have 20+ years experience as a software test engineering productivity professional. I have a passion for using technology to solve complex problems and create innovative solutions.

In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with my kids, listening to 90's music and gardening. 

You can find some samples of my personal projects on [Github](https://ptabofunda.github.io). I am constantly exploring and learning to stay ahead of the curve. I have written a few random [articles](./articles.html) that I find interesting.


I am always open to new opportunities and connections, so feel free to reach out to me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedro-tabofunda).

Thank you for visiting my page!
